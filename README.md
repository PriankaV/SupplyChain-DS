# Supply Chain Disruption Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project simulates and analyzes the impact of disruptions on a supply chain network.  
It calculates total shipping cost, shipment distances, and route changes before and after a disruption, then visualizes the results to provide actionable insights.

## Features
- **Optimization-based routing** before and after a disruption
- **Impact metrics**: cost change, distance change, number of disrupted routes, shortages
- **Visualizations**: bar charts for cost and distance comparisons
- **Geodesic calculations** for shipment distances

## Example Results
- Total Cost Before: $191,400.00
- Total Cost After: $189,900.00
- % Increase in Shipment Distance: 2.45%
- Number of Disrupted Routes: 4
- Cities with Shortages: None

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Geopy
- Matplotlib
